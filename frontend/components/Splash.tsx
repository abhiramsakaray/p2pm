/**
 * Branded full-screen splash shown while the app initializes (thirdweb wallet
 * init, prefs read, first route). Replaces the bare "Loading…" text so the wait looks
 * intentional and on-brand — important on iOS where a blank flash reads as slow.
 *
 * Pure markup + CSS (logo image), no JS/state, so it paints as early as
 * possible. The theme-init inline script in layout has already set the
 * background color before this renders, so there's no white flash either.
